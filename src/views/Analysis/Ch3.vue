      <h1>What are the impacts of</h1>
      <h1>the Australia bushfire?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The 2019–20 Australian bushfire season, colloquially known as the Black Summer, began with several serious uncontrolled fires in June 2019. The season started in early November 2019 in New South Wales, and gradually progressed in Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory. Thousands of firefighters and volunteers battled the fires, with millions of hectares burned, thousands of properties damaged, and countless numbers of wildlife exposed. In February 2020, the last fires were reportedly extinguished, with torrential rain assisting in putting out the remaining fires.</p>
      <p>Here we are considering the adverse effects of high intensity wildfires on the community and the environment. It should be remembered that it is not just intensity of a bushfire that matters. The extent of a bushfire is also very important. A large bushfire can cause multiple direct impacts: on ecological and biodiversity, on climate, and indirectly on government budgets and insurance costs. A large bushfire will also generate huge amounts of smoke.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>1. Physical, direct impacts</h2>
      <p>The 2019/2020 bushfire season in Australia had damaged over 4.3 million hectares of conservation land across the country as of March 9, 2020. Additionally, at least 2.45 million hectares of agricultural land had been damaged as a result of the fires.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Through the picture, we can find that most of the land that was affected was conservation, agriculture and forest land. New South Wales was the worst hit state in terms of area burned. Most of the land affected was conservation and forest land. Some sources estimated that at least 80 percent of the Blue Mountains, and 53 percent of the Gondwana world heritage sites were burned. As a result of the massive habitat losses, an estimated 1.5 billion animals were killed as their homes were destroyed. Livestock were also affected to a degree, with thousands of beef cattle in Victoria killed because of the fires. The impact on people was significant. At least 34 people lost their lives. Many Australians were exposed to the bushfires in some way, either directly or indirectly. Thousands of homes as well as commercial buildings were destroyed or partially damaged, and early insurance claims were valued at 1.9 billion Australian dollars in February 2020.</p>

      <h2>2. Ongoing ecological & biodiversity impacts</h2>
      <p>After initial devastation of the fires, impacts are ongoing. An estimated billion animals, and many more bats and insects, are likely to die in total over the coming weeks and months as a result of lost habitat and food sources. This loss is part of a much bigger picture of a world where biodiversity is in steep decline. We are losing wildlife at an ever-increasing scale across the planet, with impacts to ecosystems vital for our own global food production. The world’s terrestrial biodiversity is concentrated in forests: they are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. So, when forests burn, the biodiversity on which humans depend for their long-term survival also disappears in the inferno. Although all animals have their own defense mechanisms when it comes to natural disasters, the mechanisms once used have been diminished by previous fires and deforestation. With over 1 million species currently facing extinction if we continue with business as usual, extreme weather events such “megafires” become an increasing matter of concern for species survival.</p>
      <div class="pic">
        <spe class="scatter-grid" />
      </div>
      <p>The picture shows the damage of the species in Australia, the red line shows the number of genera of different specieses, the black line shows the rate of this kind of species that was affected by the bushfire, each point means a species that was affected by the bushfire. Through the picture, we can find that the number of species of plants is the most while the largest rate is bird. Comparing to the total number of species, it seems that the large number of the spceses of plant lead to the result, meanwhile, birds need trees to live on, so birds were effected a lot. Whart's more, it is easily to find that the fish, amphibians and reptiles, which can stay in water, can avoid some of the damage.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Koala</strong>
      </p>
      <p>As a kind of special species in the Australia, the devastating effect the bushfires also have had on the Koala population. They are a slow moving animal which does not allow them to flee fast enough from the fires. The Koala's defense mechanism is to climb up towards the treetops and curl themselves into a ball until danger passes. While they have adapted and evolved along wildfires, deforestation caused by human development and climate change is affecting the koalas' ability to survive. It is estimated that as many as 8,000 koalas have died from the current bushfires, and the loss of eucalyptus trees and water supply will continue to affect them when the fires are finished. About 24% of their key habitat has been destroyed.</p>
      <p>According to the following picture, Queensland and New South Wales are the two of the places where the most of the koalas stay. So, these places are the most of the places that koalas declined.</p>
      <img src="/static/img/koalamap.png" width="1000px" />
      <p>Of course, the koalas are not the only wildlife that is suffering. While many animals like kangaroos and birds can flee from the fires, fleeing also poses a threat to these animals, sometimes resulting in their being hit by cars or even attacked by dogs. If they do manage to seek refuge there is not enough water to keep them well. Temperatures have reached as high as 107 degrees Fahrenheit causing thousands of flying fox bats to fall from the sky and wiping out almost one third of this particular species. The temperatures and fires are so far from normal that wildlife's usual adaptations are no longer working.</p>

      <h2>3. Public health</h2>
      <p>As a result of intense smoke and air pollution stemming from the fires, in January 2020 reports indicated that Canberra measured the worst air quality index of any major city in the world. Wildfires produce harmful smoke which can cause fatalities. Wildfires produce fine particle air pollution, which is directly threatens human health even during relatively short exposures. Close to the fires, smoke is a health risk because it contains a mixture of hazardous gases and particles that can irritate the eyes and the respiratory system. The effects of smoke exposure and inhalation range from eye and respiratory tract irritation to more serious disorders, including reduced lung function, bronchitis, exacerbated asthma and premature death. Exposure to particulate matter is the main public health threat from short-term exposure to wildfire smoke. And actually, as to the death due to this bushfire, more than 10 times as many people die from smoke inhalation as from direct fire. According to the World Health Organization, older people, people with cardiorespiratory diseases or chronic illnesses, children, and people who work outdoors are particularly vulnerable.</p>

      <h2>4. The impacts of the fires crosses borders</h2>
      <p>Smoke from wildfires can travel great distances. It is often pushed into the stratosphere by the heat from fires. Smoke from bushfires in Australia has drifted across the Pacific and may have reached the Antarctic, according to the World Meteorological Organization. This has led to hazardous air quality in major cities throughout Australia, and affected New Zealand and cities in South America after smoke reached both Argentina and Chile.</p>

      <h2>5. Mental health costs</h2>
      <p>Fires do not only cause physical harm; many people experience mental trauma from the experience of emergency evacuation and losing homes, pets, belongings, livestock or other sources of livelihoods. Some communities found themselves unable to evacuate quickly when lost electricity meant fuel stations weren’t operational or blocked roads kept people trapped in high risk areas. Some were forced to seek safety on beaches and on boats, sheltering children overnight while witnessing unprecedented firestorms. Such experiences can have lasting mental health impacts across affected communities.</p>
      <p>Stress responses associated with surviving a natural disaster may range from low to moderate levels of distress, through to severe PTS. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a prolonged and severe psychological response to trauma, is characterised by significant physical, social, occupational, emotional or cognitive impairment. Approximately 8% of the general population experience symptoms of PTS during their lives. Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed. The incidence of PTSD in persons directly affected by the   experience of natural disaster, such as bushfire, is significantly higher than that of the general population. As such, it is suggested that 23–42% of individuals impacted by bushfire experience PTSD-related symptoms in the months following this bushfire event.</p>

      <h2>6. Economic costs</h2>
      <p>The price tag to the Australian economy is still being analyzed, but it’s clear that infrastructure has been damaged and that impacts extend to industries such as farming and tourism. Some businesses and institutions have been forced to close their doors during periods of excessive levels of air pollution.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Consumption</strong>
      </p>
      <p>The figure below shows the change of Consumer Price Index (cpi) from quarter to quarter. The places with a red background represent the large fire in that quarter. By observing the occurrence of fire and changes in cpi, it can be found that in most cases, cpi will have a downward trend in the first quarter after the fire.</p>
      <div class="pic">
        <cpi class="line" />
      </div>
      <p>It can be found that the consumption intention of Australian residents generally presents a declining trend. Although residents' willingness to consume also declined from 2018 to early 2019, the decline of residents' willingness to consume increased significantly from June 19 (the time when the fire started).</p>
      <div class="consume">
        <consume class="line" />
      </div>
      <p>
        <strong>Business</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A deeper analysis of the industries most heavily impacted shows that over a third of businesses in the Accommodation and Food services sector, which includes travel and tourism, say they have been affected ‘A great deal’ – higher than any other industry, while a third of businesses in the Transport, Postal and Warehousing sector say they have been affected to some extent.</p>
      <p>Businesses in Queensland and NSW have been the hardest hit with 12% of Queensland businesses and 11% of NSW businesses affected ‘A great deal’ by the bushfires – far higher than any other States.In general businesses in NSW are the most likely to have been impacted with over a third (35%) affected in some way compared to around a quarter of businesses in Queensland (25%) and Victoria (24%). In contrast, only 16% of businesses in WA and 11% in Tasmania have been affected at all. For the 7% that say the business has been affected ‘A great deal’ by the bushfires common impacts cited include ‘Cancelled bookings and events’, ‘Lack of access to the business or properties because of the fires’, ‘Staff not available for work because of diversion to fighting fires’, ‘Air quality’ and ‘Smoke haze’, ‘Lack of tourists’ and some have been ‘Burned out entirely’. The 10% who say their business has been ‘Somewhat’ affected by the bushfires mention ‘Loss of income’, ‘Employees sick from smoke’, ‘Employees called away for reserve duty/fighting fires’, ‘Employees unable to get to work’, ‘Customers depressed and sad’ and ‘Cancellation of jobs’. The remaining 9% who say their business has been affected ‘A little’ by the bushfires mainly refer to the ‘Smoke contamination’, and ‘Air quality’, ‘Staff taking time off to volunteer’, and a drop off in customers as there are ‘Less tourists’, ‘Less orders’, and ‘Less money available for people to spend.’</p>

        <strong>Recovery Funding</strong>
      </p>
        <p>In January 2020, the Australian federal government announced a two billion Australian dollar relief package to aid the bushfire recovery after the 2019/2020 fire season. Of this fund, 100 million Australian dollars had been allocated to primary producers in the country. Most of the funds, around 1.6 billion Australian dollars, had not yet been allocated as of that month.</p>

      <h2>7. Climate feedback loops</h2>
      <p>The bushfires have not only been made more likely and intense by climate change, they also add to it. Until the 2019–2020 Australian bushfire season, the forests in Australia were thought to reabsorb all the carbon released in bushfires across the country. This would mean the forests achieved net zero emissions. However, global warming is making bushfires burn more intensely and frequently and the 2019–2020 bushfires have already emitted 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to the Copernicus monitoring programme. This is as much as Australia's average annual carbon dioxide emissions in just the past three months. These will increase Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, and heighten the likelihood of recurring megafires that will release yet more emissions. This is a deeply concerning climate feedback loop.</p>

      <h2>8. Environmental costs: pollution</h2>
      <p>Ash from the fires has landed in school playgrounds, backyards, and is being washed up on Australia’s beaches and into freshwater stores and water catchments. Drinking water catchments are typically forested areas, and so are vulnerable to bushfire pollution. Bushfire ash contains nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous. Increased nutrient concentrations can stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria, commonly known as blue-green algae. Cyanobacteria produce chemicals which may cause a range of water quality problems, including poor taste and odour, and sometimes toxic chemicals. During a blaze, plumes of smoke, ash and other debris catch on the wind and scatter across the landscape. Sometimes they blow over the ocean, where they add nutrients. When burned soils flow into streams and rivers, they fertilize water plants and algae. The extra nutrients can have benefits in moderation but too much can over-fertilize and cause excess algal growth. Algae absorb oxygen in the water in order to grow, and deplete dissolved oxygen when they die and decompose, which can asphyxiate fish and other marine life, with localized impacts to biodiversity. The same can be true in ocean environments, where smoke has shown to have a negative impact on marine ecosystems in several past incidents: haze from record wildfires in Indonesia killed coral reefs in the late 1990s, according to a study in Science, as iron-rich smoke billowed out over the coast and fertilized the water, causing a huge plankton bloom. The resulting so-called red tide asphyxiated coral reefs around the Mentawai Islands, off southwest Sumatra.</p>

      <h2>9. Agricultural impacts</h2>
      <p>The bushfires have scorched pasture, destroyed livestock and razed vineyards, with regrowth and recovery likely to stretch water resources already challenged by drought. Reports indicate that the country’s dairy supply will likely be hit hardest, with Victoria and New South Wales—Australia’s key milk-producing states—suffering the greatest loss of farmland and infrastructure damage. Meat, wool, and honey output may also be impacted. About 13% of the national sheep flock is in regions that have been significantly impacted and a further 17% in regions partially impacted, according to Meat & Livestock Australia.</p>
      <p>At this stage the total losses of both sheep and cattle in New South Wales and Victoria are estimated at 25,000 lost, which accounts for approximately 2% of Australia’s total population of sheep and cattle. Some areas such as Kangaroo Island in South Australia have experienced significant losses. More than 100,000 sheep were destroyed, which is approximately 16% of the total population on that island.</p>
      <p>Grape and wine producers in fire-affected regions are still assessing their impact. Total loss of vines as reported by Wine Australia is estimated at only 1 % of Australia’s total vineyard area. The extent of smoke damage to grapes in vineyards near the fires will be established with testing prior to harvest in February and March.</p>
      <p>Much of the fire activity occurred in national parks and coastal areas, rather than in the key agricultural districts. The biggest impact on agriculture has been the major rainfall deficiency, particularly in Northern NSW and southern Queensland. The following map shows areas of rainfall deficiency over the 20-month period from April 2018 to December 2019 with the broadacre cropping zone superimposed.</p>
      <img src="/static/img/list10.png" width="800px" />
      <h3>Source: Bom, ABS Kynetec</h3>
      <p>The result of the low rainfall has been a much-reduced winter crop. For example, the 2019 wheat crop of 13 million tonnes was 47% below the long-term average. Irrigation storages have been greatly impacted, which has resulted in one of the smallest rice crops in history. Cotton is estimated to decline by 82% to 61,000 hectares – the lowest since 1978-1979. Grain sorghum has also declined by a huge amount – down 71% to 143,000 hectares. Irrigated dairy has been priced out of the water market by higher value permanent horticulture crops in northern Victoria. Many dairy farms in northern Victoria have been forced to cease production and sell their entire herds to abattoirs. On a more positive note, grain, beef and sheep farmers in Victoria are enjoying one of their best years in living memory. A combination of high grain, hay, beef, sheep meat and wool prices and above average yields generated a perfect storm of profit. Areas of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania also enjoyed a ‘reasonable’ 2019 season. Rainfall in January and February has been exceptional and has had the double impact of both putting all the fires out and setting up a strong soil moisture profile in the long-suffering agricultural districts of Northern NSW and Southern Queensland. This is ideal for the coming winter cropping season.</p>
