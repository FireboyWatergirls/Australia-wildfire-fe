      <h2>What is a bushfire?</h2>
      <p>Bushfires and grassfires are common throughout Australia. Grassfires are fast moving, passing in five to ten seconds and smouldering for minutes. They have a low to medium intensity and primarily damage crops, livestock and farming infrastructure, such as fences. Bushfires are generally slower moving, but have a higher heat output. This means they pass in two to five minutes, but they can smoulder for days. Fire in the crown of the tree canopy can move rapidly.</p>
      <p>Bushfires are an intrinsic part of Australia's environment. Natural ecosystems have evolved with fire, and the landscape, along with its biological diversity, has been shaped by both historic and recent fires. Many of Australia's native plants are fire prone and very combustible, while numerous species depend on fire to regenerate. Indigenous Australians have long used fire as a land management tool and it continues to be used to clear land for agricultural purposes and to protect properties from intense, uncontrolled fires.</p>
      <p>Historically, bushfires have caused loss of life and significant damage to property. While naturally occurring bushfires cannot be averted, their consequences can be minimised by implementing mitigation strategies and reducing the potential impact to areas which are most vulnerable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="part">
      <h2>What factors create a favourable environment for bushfires to occur?</h2>
      <p>The basic factors which determine whether a bushfire will occur include the presence of fuel, oxygen and an ignition source. The fire intensity and speed at which a bushfire spreads will depend on ambient temperature, fuel load, fuel moisture, wind speed and slope angle.</p>
      <h3>Fuel load</h3>
      <p>Fuel load describes the amount of fallen bark, leaf litter and small branches accumulating in the landscape. Generally speaking, the greater the fuel load, the hotter and more intense the fire. Fuel which is concentrated but loosely compacted will burn faster than heavily compacted or scattered fuel sources. Smaller pieces of fuel such as twigs, leaf litter and branches burn quickly, particularly when they are dry and loosely arranged and will burn quickly in the fire front. Larger fuels, such as tree trunks often burn later after the fire front has passed. The natural oil within eucalypt trees promotes the combustion of fuel.</p>
      <h3>Fuel moisture</h3>
      <p>Dry fuel will burn quickly, but damp or wet fuel may not burn at all. As a consequence, the time since rainfall and the amount of rain received is an important consideration in assessing bushfire danger. Often a measure of the drought factor, or moisture deficit, will be used as an indicator of extreme bushfire weather conditions.</p>
      <h3>Wind speed</h3>
      <p>Wind acts to drive a fire by blowing the flames into fresh fuel, bringing it to ignition point and providing a continuous supply of oxygen. Wind also promotes the rapid spread of fire by spotting, which is the ignition of new fires by burning embers lofted into the air by wind. Spotting can occur up to 30km downwind from the fire front.</p>
      <p>There is a threshold wind speed of around 12 to 15km/h which makes a significant difference in the behaviour of bushfires in the open. When wind speeds are below this threshold, fires with heavy fuel loads burn slowly. However, even a slight increase in wind speed above this threshold results in a significant increase in fire behaviour and advancement. The width of a fire front also has an influence on the rate of spread and a wind shift can immediately widen the forward edge of a fire.</p>
      <h3>Ambient temperature</h3>
      <p>The higher the temperature the more likely it is that a fire will start or continue to burn. This is because the fuel is closer to its ignition point at high temperatures and pre-heated fuel loads burn faster.</p>
      <h3>Relative humidity</h3>
      <p>Dry air promotes a greater intensity fire than moist air. Plants become more flammable at a low humidity because they release their moisture more easily.</p>
      <h3>Slope angle</h3>
      <p>Fires pre-heat their fuel source through radiation and convection. As a result, fires accelerate when travelling uphill and decelerate travelling downhill. The steepness of the slope plays an important role in the rate of fire spread. The speed of a fire front advancing will double with every 10 degree increase in slope, so that on a 20 degree slope, its speed of advance is four times greater than on flat ground.</p>
      <h3>Ignition Source</h3>
      <p>Bushfires can originate from both human activity and natural causes with lightning the predominant natural source, accounting for about half of all ignitions in Australia. Fires of human origin currently account for the remainder and are classified as accidental or deliberate. Fires lit deliberately can be the result of arson or might be designed to achieve a beneficial outcome but conditions have changed, resulting in uncontrollable spread.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately deliberate and accidentally lit fires are more prevalent near populated areas and have a disproportionately higher risk of infrastructure impact. Arsonists place people and property at serious and unnecessary risk, particularly when igniting fires on extreme fire weather days.</p>

    <div class="part">
      <h2>Where do bushfires occur?</h2>
      <p>The Australian climate is generally hot, dry and prone to drought. At any time of the year, some parts of Australia are prone to bushfires. The widely varied fire seasons are reflected in the continent's different weather patterns. For most of southern Australia, the danger period is summer and autumn. For New South Wales and southern Queensland, the peak risk usually occurs in spring and early summer. The Northern Territory experiences most of its fires in winter and spring.</p>
      <p>Grassland fires frequently occur after good periods of rainfall which result in abundant growth that dries out in hot weather. Bushfires tend to occur when light and heavy fuel loads in Eucalypt forests have dried out, usually following periods of low rainfall.</p>
      <p>The potential for extreme fire weather varies greatly throughout Australia, both in frequency and severity. When potential extreme fire weather is experienced close to populated areas, significant loss is possible. In terms of the total area burnt, the largest fires are in the Northern Territory and northern areas of Western Australia and Queensland. Most loss of life and economic damage occurs around the fringes of cities where homes are commonly in close proximity to flammable vegetation.</p>

    <div class="part">
      <h2>Bushfire weather</h2>
      <p>In the years between 1967 and 2013, major Australian bushfires have resulted in over 8000 injuries and 433 fatalities, close to 50 per cent of all deaths from major Australian natural disasters in the period (excluding heatwaves). Over this same period, bushfires cost approximately A$4.7 billion (2013 Australian dollars, including deaths and injuries but excluding most indirect losses).</p>
      <p>Bushfire activity varies across Australia with the changes in the seasonal weather patterns. Wind, temperature, humidity and rainfall are weather elements that affect the behaviours of bushfires.</p>

        <h3>Australia's fire weather seasons</h3>
        <p>While bush fires can happen at any time of the year in Australia, the time of peak bushfire activity varies across the country with the changes in the seasonal weather patterns.</p>
        <p>For northern Australia the peak bushfire period is during the dry season, which is generally throughout winter and spring. In southern Australia the bushfire season peaks in summer and autumn. While these are traditional peaks of the bushfire season, local conditions can drive dangerous bushfire activity at any time.</p>

        </h1>
        <p>Weather systems work differently across Australia's temperate and tropical regions. Severe bushfire conditions are influenced by a combination of these systems, but in most cases by hot, dry winds blowing from central Australia. The dry summer months are the danger time for southern Australia, while northern Australia is at risk during winter.</p>
        <br />
        <div class="p2">
          <strong>Southeast Australia—summer and autumn</strong>
        </div>
        <p>As grass and forests dry during summer and autumn, southeast Australia becomes vulnerable to the threat of bushfire. During late spring and early summer grass and forest fuels hold some moisture but fires can occur on hot days with strong winds. Fuels dry out in mid and late summer but winds are typically not as strong. Early autumn sees a transition to cooler conditions and generally lighter winds.</p>
        <br />
        <div class="p2">
          <strong>New South Wales and southern Queensland—spring to mid-summer</strong>
        </div>
        <p>The greatest danger occurs after the dry winter and spring. The worst conditions occur when deep low-pressure systems near Tasmania bring strong, hot and dry, westerly winds to the coastal districts. The end of the fire season is determined by the onset of moister conditions, sometimes the result of a tropical cyclone developing near the Queensland coast.</p>
        <br />
        <div class="p2">
          <strong>Northwest Western Australia and the Northern Territory—winter and spring</strong>
        </div>
        <p>In the warm, dry and sunny winter and spring, when grasses are dead and fuels have dried, northern Australia becomes most susceptible to bushfires. Intense high-pressure systems over South Australia producing strong southeast to northeast winds increase the risk of bushfires.</p>
        <br />
        <div class="p2">
          <strong>Southern Western Australia—spring and summer</strong>
        </div>
        <p>The greatest danger is between late spring and early autumn when fuels have dried after the winter rains. Heat troughs intensifying near the Pilbara, with surges of hot air from the interior produce dangerous fire weather conditions.</p>

        <br />
        <h3>How does weather influence fire behaviour?</h3>
        <p>Weather conditions influence the size, intensity, speed, and predictability of bushfires and how dangerous they can be to the community.</p>
        <p>Vegetation growth can be encouraged by periods of wet weather, increasing the amount of fuel available (grass, leaf litter, twigs, bark). When the weather is hot, the humidity is low and there's been little recent rain, this vegetation dries out and becomes more flammable. A fire is more likely to start, and continue to burn, in hot, dry and windy weather.</p>
        <br />
        <div class="p2">
          <strong>Humidity</strong>
        </div>
        <p>Relative humidity is commonly used to measure atmospheric moisture. It is defined as the ratio of the amount of water vapour measured to what the air could hold at saturation point. Very low relative humidity, say less than 20%, causes fuels to dry out and become more flammable.</p>
        <br />
        <div class="p2">
          <strong>Wind</strong>
        </div>
        <p>Strong gusty winds help fan the flames and cause a fire to spread faster across the landscape. Strong winds can carry hot embers long distances - these can start spot fires many kilometres ahead of the main fire front.</p>
        <p>A change in wind direction can bring a period of dangerous bushfire activity, this is often seen as a trough or cold front - also known as a cool change.</p>
        <p>In southern Australia, cold fronts are probably the most powerful influence on our fire weather. Cold fronts occur at the junction of warm and cold air masses where the strong temperature contrast provides the energy source that generates the frequently associated strong winds.</p>
        <p>As a cold front passes, the wind direction will often swing about 90 degrees. Usually, the winds ahead of a cold front are hot northwesterlies, while cooler southwesterlies follow the front, with significant effects on the behaviour and structure of existing fires.</p>

        <div class="p2">
          <strong>Rainfall</strong>
        </div>
        <p>Dry grass, parched native shrubs and dead leaves and twigs are a fire's basic fuel. During droughts and in very hot, windy weather, even heavy fuels like large logs and the green leaves and smaller branches of large trees can become dry and flammable.</p>
        <p>Heavy rainfall might quench a fire, but it can make it difficult for firefighters to access burnt areas. Where fires have been intense, or occur over steep terrain, heavy rain might cause severe erosion and affect water quality when rivers carry ash and sediment along.</p>
        <br />
        <div class="p2">
          <strong>Lightning</strong>
        </div>
        <p>In some parts of Australia lightning is the main source of bushfire ignition. The winds during thunderstorms can make it hard to predict the behaviour and movement of a bushfire.</p>
        <p>Large fires can also create their own thunderstorms known as pyrocumulonimbus. They can cause erratic more intense and dangerous bushfire behaviour. Find out more about pyrocumulonimbus at the Bureau Blog.</p>
        <br />
        <div class="p2">
          <strong>Temperature inversions</strong>
        </div>
        <p>A layer of warm air sitting over a layer of cold air is called a temperature inversion. Inversions are common during the night and early morning when cool night air collects close to the ground (Figure 4). This arrangement of air is stable because cold air near the ground is heavy and tends to stay near the ground. The warm air above the inversion is lighter and tends to stay above the inversion.</p>
        <p>There are often strong winds in the warm air above inversions, but while the inversion lasts these winds cannot come down to ground level.</p>
        <p>As the sun heats the ground during the day, the inversion weakens and strong winds may begin to blow near the ground (Figure 5). This is one reason why many bushfires burn more fiercely in the afternoon, as happened with the fires in Hobart in 1967.</p>

        <div class="p2">
          <strong>Smoke</strong>
        </div>
        <p>Inversions also have an influence on the smoke produced by a fire. In stable conditions, when an inversion is strong, smoke is trapped close to the ground causing issues with air quality and visibility. Once the inversion breaks, typically in the late morning, the smoke becomes more mixed with clear air and disperses through the atmosphere. New smoke produced by the fire forms a neat plume that moves downstream away from the fire.</p>
        <p>The mixing height, which is available to view on MetEye under the Wind Forecasts section, is an indicator of whether smoke will be trapped on a particular day. When there is low mixing height (less than 1000 metres), smoke will stay near the ground. When the mixing height is higher (greater than 2000 metres), smoke will disperse higher into the atmosphere and air quality will improve at the ground.</p>

        <h3>Climate change and bushfire risk in Australia</h3>
        <p>Climate change is influencing the frequency and severity of dangerous bushfire conditions in Australia and other regions of the world, including through influencing temperature, environmental moisture, weather patterns and fuel conditions. There have been significant changes observed in recent decades towards more dangerous bushfire weather conditions for various regions of Australia.</p>
        <p>In particular, observed changes in southern and eastern Australia include more extreme conditions during summer, as well as an earlier start to the bushfire season with dangerous weather conditions occurring significantly earlier in spring than they used to. These trends towards more dangerous bushfire conditions are at least partly attributable to human-caused climate change, including through increased temperatures. Northern Australia, which sees significant fire activity during the dry season, has experienced increases in monsoonal rainfall that have increased fuel growth in recent decades, as a key factor influencing fire danger in that region.</p>
        <p>In relation to fire ignition, there is some indication that climate change could influence the risk of ignitions from dry-lightning (i.e., lightning that occurs without significant rainfall) while noting relatively large uncertainties in currently available model representations of this phenomenon. Additionally, there has recently been a number of devastating fire events in Australia associated with extreme pyroconvection (including thunderstorm development in a fire plume), with recent research indicating a long-term trend towards increased risk factors associated with pyroconvection in southeast Australia. Bushfire weather conditions in future years are projected to increase in severity for many regions of Australasia, including due to more extreme heat events, with the rate and magnitude of change increasing with greenhouse gas concentrations (and emissions).</p>
